# Secant_method_geometric_structure_minimzation
Apply the secant method to obtain the stable geometric structure


Problem statement:
 Apply the secant method to obtain the stable geometric structure of clusters of ions (Na^{+})_{n}(Cl^{âˆ’})_{m},
    where n and m are small positive integers.
     Use the empirical interaction potential given in Eq. (5.64) at book for the ions
